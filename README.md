A collection of BTD6 Mods - MODS NOT MADE BY ME

## Powers In Shop
This mod adds all of the powers you buy using monkey money into the in-game shop. This is very useful if you do not want to use monkey money to buy a banana farmer, or anything else.

## Speed Hack
This mod will speed up your game by a lot. This is useful trying to go lategame, or doing anything boring as it can speed through it. To start, make sure you have double clicked the start button putting it into double speed mode. Control the mod it using 6,7,8,9,0 and reset it using 5.
